# Princeton LabQueue Extras
For use with labqueue.io - allows the user to choose a sound that will play each time a student is added to the queue, either when they first log on or are added through a "reopen." Also allows enabling browser notifications that navigate back to the queue. Configuration options appear below the queue table.

## @labTA's
Feel free to modify the source code, especially if you know Javascript! I just learned JS/CSS this week to write this so I'm positive there are more efficient ways of doing things.

# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
## Chrome:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cdfnncficbjkiddobflmiiceggikbdgc/publish-accepted?hl=en&authuser=0

## Firefox
Download Greasemonkey and use lqsound.user.js as the source file.
## Other browsers
Similar solution to Firefox except with different extensions to handle running the script. On Chrome and Microsoft Edge, there's an extension called Tampermonkey that basically does the same thing. On Safari, there's SIMBL/GreaseKit (not sure how these work).
